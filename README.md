# Smart-Alarm-Clock-app

A smart alarm clock app, where the user has to choose between 2 different options to turn off the alarm:

1. Take a picture of an item mentioned in the app (like a toothbrush, comb, etc.)
2. Say the sentence mentioned in the app out loud.

The project was made using Python, object detection AI, File handling, GitHub repositories, and python libraries.

The project was a part of a group work for an university course about Smart Systems, and I was responsible for the file handling and speech recognition functions.
